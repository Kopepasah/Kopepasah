# **Hey-yo!** 👋🏻

Thanks for taking the time to view my GitHub profile. Here you'll find a bit of information [about me](https://kopepasah.com/) as a Software Engineer, but in reality wear many, many hats — including being a [reformed convict](https://koop.sh/speaking/wordcamp-us-talk-about-how-wordpress-helped-a-reformed-convict-20230825602/).

The question I get asked most when first meeting someone is how to pronounce my surname: _Kopepasah_ ( it's _koop-sah_ or _koop-saw_ — I've heard it both ways 😆). I have never met someone that can pronounce it correctly the first time (so don't worry about offending me!). Lastly, my surname is First American ([Comanche Nation](https://comanchenation.com/)) and means "Standing on the Edge of the Mountain". 🤯

These days, I code mostly with [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) ([TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) & [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(software))), but am always learning and growing into new areas. I consider myself a Lead Full-stack Software Engineer because I often cover all aspects of a development project, even project planning and management of other engineers. As someone who constantly strives to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, AI already plays a huge role in my day-to-day developemnt, including using AI in several of my personal projects and small-business initiatives.
