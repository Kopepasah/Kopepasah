# **Hey-yo!** 👋🏻

Thanks for taking the time to view my GitHub profile. Here you'll find a bit of information [about me](https://kopepasah.com/) as a Software Engineer, but in reality wear many, many hats — including being a [reformed convict](https://koop.sh/speaking/wordcamp-us-talk-about-how-wordpress-helped-a-reformed-convict-20230825602/).

The question I get asked most when first meeting someone is how to pronounce my surname: _Kopepasah_ ( it's _koop-sah_ or _koop-saw_ — I've heard it both ways 😆). I have never met someone that can pronounce it correctly the first time (so don't worry about offending me!). Lastly, my surname is First American (Comanche Nation) and means "Standing on the Edge of the Mountain". 🤯

These days, I code mostly with PHP and JavaScript (TypeScript & React), but am always learning and growing into new areas. I consider myself a Lead Full-stack Software Engineer because I often cover all aspects of a development project, even project planning and management of other engineers. AI already plays a huge role in my day-to-day developemnt, including using AI in several of my personal projects and small-business initiatives.
